      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Amari! This is my website for the purpose of TeamTreeHouse. That is all you need to know about me.
      
      Well, except for one thing: that is not actually me in the photo above. I know bummer, right? I can't smile that greatly. I only aspire to one day smile as amazingly as Nick Pettit smiled for that photo.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to follow my shenanigans on Twitter, my username is <a href="http://www.twitter.com/NymtonksB">@NymtonksB</a>.</p>
